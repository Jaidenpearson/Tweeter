# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

## UI

Below are screenshots of the UI. Buttons are highlighted to display app usage.

The 'Write a new tweet' button in the top right corner of the screen can be selected to hide or reveal the new tweet form above all the displayed tweets.

When a tweet is ready to be submitted the 'Tweet' button on the form will submit to the server and display the new tweet first on the page.

In the second screenshot a button can be found on the bottom right area of the screen when the user has scrolled away from the nav bar. This button will return the user to the top of the page and reveal the tweet form.

The third screenshot displays the responsive design between desktop and mobile devices, switching from a two column, to a single column design.
